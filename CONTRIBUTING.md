# Contributing to Threshold Vision Theory (TVT)

Threshold Vision Theory describes an intentional, phase-based narrowing of visual input that may allow access to symbolic memory, emotional data retrieval, and ancestral cognition. It is non-clinical, non-harmful, and fully reversible.

You are invited to contribute structured insights that deepen, refine, or question this model.
