Threshold Vision Theory (TVT) explores a unique perceptual phenomenon in which an individual can voluntarily suppress visual input in mid-range ambient light, leading to a progressive narrowing of vision and eventual blackout. This state is non-pathological, fully reversible, and may grant access to deeper cognitive functions such as symbolic thought, emotional memory retrieval, or ancestral pattern recognition.

Unlike tunnel vision from anxiety or sensory shutdowns in neurodivergence, TVT is intentional, environmentally triggered, and follows a distinct phase progression. This repository documents the theory, mechanisms, potential applications, and experimental paths forward for one of the most novel cognitive gateways identified in modern consciousness studies.
